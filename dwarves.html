      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Dwarves are a proud and formidable race created by Aulë the Smith. Renowned for their skill in mining, metalwork, and warcraft, they value loyalty, honor, and lineage. Though not numerous, they have altered the course of Middle-earth's history through key battles, resilient strongholds, and legendary individuals.

      <h2>Strongholds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Khazad-dûm (Moria)</strong> – The original and greatest Dwarven kingdom. Abandoned due to the Balrog's awakening.</li>
        <li><strong>Erebor (The Lonely Mountain)</strong> – A mighty mountain fortress reclaimed from Smaug. Symbol of Dwarven resurgence.</li>
        <li><strong>Iron Hills</strong> – A militarized stronghold ruled by Dáin Ironfoot. Key to the victory at the Battle of the Five Armies.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue Mountains (Ered Luin)</strong> – Home to many exiled Dwarves after Erebor's fall. Base of Thorin's Company before the quest.</li>

      <h2>Major Battles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle of Azanulbizar (2799 TA)</strong><br/>
          Part of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Fought at the East-gate of Moria. Though victorious, the Dwarves suffered heavy casualties. Thorin earned the name "Oakenshield" in this battle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle of the Five Armies (2941 TA)</strong><br/>
          Following the death of Smaug, Thranduil led an Elven host to Erebor to claim part of the treasure. Bard and the Men of Lake-town joined him in demand. Thorin, unwilling to yield, fortified Erebor and called for aid. Dáin Ironfoot responded, marching with Iron Hills warriors. Before open conflict erupted between Elves, Men, and Dwarves, Orcs and Wargs from Mount Gundabad and the north descended upon Erebor. The three Free Peoples united against the common threat. Thorin, Kíli, and Fíli led a charge from the mountain but were slain. Dáin took command, winning the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Defense of Erebor (War of the Ring)</strong><br/>
          Easterling armies assaulted Erebor and Dale during Sauron’s final campaign. Dáin Ironfoot and King Brand of Dale fell in battle, but their sons Thorin III and Bard II held the stronghold until Sauron’s fall.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skirmishes in Moria (2989–2994 TA)</strong><br/>
          Balin led an expedition to reclaim Moria but was killed in ambush. The colony was overrun by Orcs. The remnants of this failed attempt were discovered by the Fellowship decades later.
