      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Dwarves are a proud and formidable race created by Aulë the Smith. Renowned for their skill in mining, metalwork, and warcraft, they value loyalty, honor, and lineage. Though not numerous, they have altered the course of Middle-earth's history through key battles, resilient strongholds, and legendary individuals.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle of the Five Armies (2941 TA)</strong><br/>
          Following the death of Smaug, Thranduil led an Elven host to Erebor to claim part of the treasure. The Elves initially attempted to take Erebor by force before Dáin Ironfoot and the Iron Hills reinforcements arrived. Bard and the Men of Lake-town joined the Elves in this demand. Orcs and Wargs from Mount Gundabad and the northern wastes then descended upon the mountain. The Free Peoples united against this common enemy. Thorin, Kíli, and Fíli led a desperate charge but were slain. Dáin took command and secured victory.<br/>

          <strong>Defense of Erebor (War of the Ring)</strong><br/>
