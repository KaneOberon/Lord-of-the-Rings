      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Ents are ancient tree-like beings created by Yavanna in the First Age to protect the forests of Middle-earth. Known as the "Shepherds of the Trees," Ents are strong, long-lived, and deeply connected to nature. Though slow to act, when roused to anger they become a force of overwhelming destruction.</p>

      <h2>Strongholds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fangorn Forest</strong> – The last ancient forest in Middle-earth and the home of the Ents. Located southeast of Isengard at the foot of the Misty Mountains.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Major Battles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>March of the Ents / Attack on Isengard</strong><br/>
          After witnessing the devastation Saruman inflicted on Fangorn through industrial deforestation, Treebeard called an Entmoot — a rare council of Ents — to decide their response. Convinced by Merry and Pippin and the evidence of ruin, the Ents declared war. They marched directly on Isengard, breaching its outer wall with brute force, hurling boulders, and tearing apart war machines. They destroyed the dam on the River Isen, flooding the pits and forges, cutting off Saruman’s production lines and effectively neutralizing his industrial power.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aftermath of the Battle of Helm's Deep</strong><br/>
          While the Ents did not fight at Helm’s Deep, they played a critical role after the battle. As the defeated Uruk-hai fled into Fangorn Forest, they were never seen again. The Huorns — tree-like beings allied with the Ents — surrounded and annihilated the retreating enemy, ensuring complete battlefield control and no chance for regrouping.

      <h2>Notable Ents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Treebeard (Fangorn)</strong> – The oldest Ent in Middle-earth. Wise and ancient, he led the March on Isengard. Acts as the unofficial leader and voice of the Ents.</li>
        <li><strong>Quickbeam (Bregalad)</strong> – Youngest of the Ents, known for his rare hastiness. He was one of the first to agree to take up arms and joined the assault on Isengard directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Beechbone</strong> – An Ent who fought in the battle of Isengard and was tragically set ablaze by Saruman’s fire. His death enraged the Ents further, intensifying their assault.</li>
        <li><strong>Finglas and Fladrif</strong> – Older Ents who became increasingly "tree-ish" and isolated over the centuries. Though they did not fight at Isengard, they represent the dwindling Ent race.</li>
        <li><strong>The Huorns</strong> – A mysterious race closely related to the Ents. Sentient but more tree-like. Though silent, they acted decisively at Helm’s Deep to eliminate Saruman’s retreating Uruk-hai in a complete ambush within Fangorn.</li>
      </ul>
