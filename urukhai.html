      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Uruk-hai are a genetically modified breed of orcs, created by Saruman in Isengard and later adapted by Sauron. Unlike standard orcs, they are stronger, more intelligent, capable of enduring sunlight, and trained in military discipline. They serve as shock infantry and enforcers in major campaigns during the late Third Age.</p>

      <h2>Origins & Strongholds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Isengard</strong> – Saruman's fortress and primary breeding ground, utilizing dark alchemy and genetic engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Barad-dûr</strong> – Sauron’s central command in Mordor, where Uruk-hai were deployed as elite strike units.</li>
        <li><strong>Mount Doom (Orodruin)</strong> – Though not a fortress, it is the heart of Sauron’s dark power and a heavily guarded strategic objective. Uruk-hai and orc patrols were stationed throughout the surrounding plains to defend its perimeter during the final phase of the War of the Ring.</li>
        <li><strong>Dol Guldur</strong> – Southern Mirkwood outpost of Sauron; known to house Uruk-hai detachments and dark experiments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role in Middle-earth</h2>
      <p>Uruk-hai served as elite infantry and enforcers in Saruman’s campaign against Rohan, and as shock troops for Sauron’s armies. Their cohesion, armor, and brutal tactics made them a superior combat unit, especially in close-quarters sieges and ambushes.</p>

      <h2>Major Battles & Operations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle of the Five Armies</strong><br/>
          While Saruman had not yet mass-deployed Uruk-hai in the south, early northern Uruk offshoots resembling their breed appeared in the assault on Erebor. These heavily armored orcs, from Mount Gundabad and Dol Guldur, formed the vanguard against the allied forces of Dwarves, Elves, and Men.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ambush at Amon Hen</strong><br/>
          Saruman’s Uruk-hai under Lurtz ambushed the Fellowship near Parth Galen. Their objective was to capture the Ring-bearer. They succeeded in killing Boromir and capturing Merry and Pippin, triggering a tactical split in the Fellowship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle of Helm’s Deep</strong><br/>
          The largest single engagement of Saruman’s campaign. 10,000 Uruk-hai laid siege to the Hornburg, overwhelming defenses with siege ladders, explosives, and relentless frontal assaults. Victory was only denied by the arrival of Rohirrim cavalry under Gandalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skirmish of Fangorn Forest</strong><br/>
          Following Helm’s Deep, retreating Uruk-hai forces were annihilated in ambushes by the Ents and Huorns, wiping out the remnants of Saruman’s expeditionary force.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Siege of Minas Tirith (Battle of the Pelennor Fields)</strong><br/>
          Sauron’s Uruk-hai were deployed as core storm units, supporting trolls and siege towers. They breached outer defenses and inflicted heavy casualties on Gondor’s ranks before being pushed back by Rohirrim cavalry and Aragorn’s reinforcements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle of the Black Gate</strong><br/>
          Final coordinated deployment of Sauron’s Uruk-hai during the decoy assault at the Morannon. Their objective: crush the remaining resistance while Frodo approached Mount Doom. They fought with unwavering discipline until the destruction of the Ring caused their rout and annihilation.
